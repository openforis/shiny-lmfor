#### The use of the tools requires that there are some sample plot data available for this estimation. Each (sub)  plot should preferably have at least one height sample tree.

#### The input data file should be in CSV format, and contain the following fields: (cluster,) plot, tree_dbh,  tree_height. Field ‘cluster’ is optional if sampling design does not group plots into clusters.

#### After uploading the data, the program shows a DBH-Height scatterplot. In this  chart “plot_id” a small hover box shows a combination of “cluster” and “plot” codes.
